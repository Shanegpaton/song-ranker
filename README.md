## ⚠️ Note on Running Locally

Due to Spotify API authorization requirements, this project is not configured for public cloning and running out-of-the-box.

To run it yourself:
- You’ll need to register your own Spotify developer app to get API credentials.
- Replace the API keys and redirect URI in the code.
- The `.env` file used is not included due to security reasons.
